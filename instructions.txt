Package is published to NPM Package registry

Package name: @jsphkhan/esm-package

This is a scoped public package

I am using Babel to compile

Build and Publish package:
--------------------------
npm run build:babel <- this will create the dist folder
npm version <major/minor/patch>
npm publish

This package only produces CommonJS modules, which are difficult to tree shake. So if you do named imports
from this package it will not tree shake
eg. import { isClient } from '@jsphkhan/non-esm-package';
This will import all the modules from the index file

For ESM modules see /esm-package project
